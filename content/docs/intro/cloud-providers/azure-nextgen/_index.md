The Azure Next Gen provider for Pulumi can be used to provision any of the cloud resources available in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) via Azure Resource Manager (ARM).  The Azure provider must be configured with credentials to deploy and update resources in Azure.

See the [full API documentation]({{< relref "/docs/reference/pkg/azure-nextgen" >}}) for complete details of the available Azure provider APIs.

## Setup

The Azure Next Gen provider supports several options for providing access to Azure credentials.  See [Azure setup page]({{< relref "/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure-nextgen/setup" >}}) for details.

## Getting Started

**TODO: Update this section.**

The quickest way to get started with Azure is to follow the [Get Started]({{< relref "/docs/get-started/azure" >}}) guide.

Additionally, a tutorial is available to follow:

* [Azure Container Instances Web Server]({{< relref "/docs/tutorials/azure/container-webserver" >}}): Create an NGINX web server Azure Container Instance

In addition to the tutorial, several interesting examples are available complete with instructions:

* [Azure Function Apps](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-functions): Create a serverless function
* [Azure AppService with SQL and AppInsights](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-appservice): Build an AppService web application that uses SQL and AppInsights
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-aks-helm): Create an AKS cluster and deploy a Helm Chart into it
* [Azure CosmosDB, AKS and Node.js](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-aks-mean): Stands up an AKS cluster and a MongoDB-flavored instance of CosmosDB used by a Node.js application.

## Example

```typescript
import * as resources from "@pulumi/azure-nextgen/resources/latest";

const resourceGroup = new resources.ResourceGroup("resourceGroup", {
  resourceGroupName: "my-rg",
  location: "WestUS",
});
```

Above is one example of an Azure resource group using Pulumi. You can find additional examples in [the Pulumi examples repo](https://github.com/pulumi/examples).

## Libraries

The following packages are available in package managers:

* JavaScript/TypeScript: [`@pulumi/azure-nextgen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pulumi/azure-nextgen)
* Python: [`pulumi-azure-nextgen`](https://pypi.org/project/pulumi-azure-nextgen/)

* .NET: [`Pulumi.AzureNextGen`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pulumi.AzureNextGen)

The Azure Next Gen provider is open source and available in the [pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen) repo.
